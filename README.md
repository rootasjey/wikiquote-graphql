# Wikiquote-graphql

A GraphQL API server for [Wikiquote](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Main_Page)

[Now server](https://wikiquote-graphql-ypolufuvns.now.sh)

## Motivation

I wanted to create a quote application and existing API sources are not satisfying.

About Wikiquote REST API, it doesn't seem clean enough for a newbie, so I decided to build a much simpler API server on top of the existing ones.

## Features

For now, the API provide very minimal feature as I've juste started. I'll add more features step by step. Feel free to help me :)
